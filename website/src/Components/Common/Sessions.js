      <b>Individual Lessons</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Individual sessions incorporate elements of Awareness Through Movement®
      lessons as well as Functional Intergration® lessons where one on one
      hands-on sessions are offered. Each session is specifically talilored
      for each person’s needs at that particular moment. Opportunities for
      self discovery and learning through kinesthetic touch provide insight
      into patterns of movement, of thought, and one’s self-image. Sessions
      are designed to empower an individual to find out for themselves what
      are easier and better movement strategies. Habitual patterns are not
      only highlighted that may be causing harm or are ineffectual, but
      facilitation of independence in mastery of self-organization and
      self-use allow the student to eventually become their own teacher.
