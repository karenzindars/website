          Karen’s interest in movement began at the early age of five with
          classical ballet training. Since then she continued dancing, danced
          professionally for over 20 years, and then taught dance and movement
          to students of all levels and ages.
        </p>
        <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
          While dancing professionally, she furthered her studies of movement
          and movement science at The University of California, Berkeley in
          Physical Education and Kinesiology. In 1990 she completed her
          Master’s Degree in Physical Therapy <b>(MPT)</b> from the University of
          California, San Francisco Medical School.
        </p>
        <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
          For over 30 years Karen has worked as a licensed physical therapist
          in outpatient orthopedics. Her experience includes working with a
          broad range of people, from those with severe neurological deficits,
          repetitive strain injuries, and post-operative diagnoses, to
          high-level athletes wanting to improve their performance.
        </p>
        <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
          In 2006 she completed her training in The Feldenkrais Method® <b>(GCFT)</b>,
          which helped to bridge her experience in rehabilitation with her
          experience in dance and movement education.  The Feldenkrais Method®
          has enabled her to facilitate recovery more quickly and with more
          lasting results and learning for the people she works with. Often
          times, where other therapies have failed, her use of The Feldenkrais
          Method® has produced positive outcomes.
        </p>
        <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
          She received her certification as a <b>MBS Master Practitioner</b> from the
          Mind Body Studies Academy with Master Trainers Mia Segal and Leora
          Gaster in 2011.  The following year, in 2012, Karen was awarded Guild
          Certification as an Assistant Trainer in The Feldenkrais Method®,
          allowing her to teach and share her breadth of experience and
          knowledge in professional training programs.
