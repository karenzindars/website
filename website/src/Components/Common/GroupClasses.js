        Awareness Through MovementÂ® lessons are offered as verbally guided
        movement explorations in order to learn about our habitual movement
        patterns and help distinguish alternative possibilities. Through this
        process of self discovery, often times the key to unlocking and going
        beyond our usual patterns of self use is uncovered, offering an
        opportunity to become aware of the variety of choices accessible for us
        in each moment. Becoming familiar with what we do and how we do it
        opens the door to new possibilities in how we choose to move through
        life.
